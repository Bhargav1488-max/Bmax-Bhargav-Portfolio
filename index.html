          Deployed a YouTube Clone on Azure! 

Thrilled to share that I successfully deployed a fully functional YouTube clone into an Azure Resource Group! The codebase was forked from a well-structured repository, and I customized it to leverage Azure's robust cloud capabilities.</p> 

Technical Highlights:

Cloud Deployment:</p>  </p> -</p> Hosted the application using Azure App Services, ensuring scalability and high availability.
Storage Integration:</p> </p> -</p>   Configured Azure Blob Storage for efficient media handling.
Database Management:</p> </p> -</p>   Deployed an Azure SQL Database for structured and reliable data storage.
Networking:</p> </p> -</p>  Utilized Azure Application Gateway for secure and optimized traffic distribution.
CI/CD Pipeline:</p> </p> -</p>   Implemented a streamlined deployment process via GitHub Actions, enabling seamless code updates.
This project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into Azure's ecosystem while working with modern web technologies. It's exciting to see everything come together in a cloud-native environment!
